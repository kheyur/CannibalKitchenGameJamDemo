Lore:
The world’s meat supply has all but diminished, however, you,
a top-tier gourmet chef seem to have access to the only meat left in the world.
This makes your restaurant a highly sought after and extremely exclusive venue.
So what is your trade secret? You use a few of the customer’s human flesh to create your meals.
A rather simple solution that surprisingly no-one has seemed to think of.
